### CG Monorepo ###
Collection of different Computer Graphics projects, either as a refresher or to learn new things. 

# Directories
As this is a big monorepo of very different projects each directory will contain vastly different things, here is a reference for each.
 - [**Assets/\***](./Assets/)
    - Contains mostly shader code, used to refresh on concepts such as deferred lights, fog etc...
 - [**Vulkan/\***](./Vulkan/)
    - A project containing code related to the [vulkan tutorials](https://vulkan-tutorial.com), the environment setup differs from the one in the tutorial as I am stubborn and like to work with vsCode. 
    Project uses a combo of Cmake and CPM to work, plus some custom environment variables.
